{"name":"Mykanban","tagline":"Open source project to create simple, general purpose Kanban software","body":"# MyKanban\r\nMyKanban is an open source project to create simple, general purpose Kanban software.\r\n\r\n# The BIG Idea …\r\n* Create an integrated application framework for task management, based on the Kanban board concept, that developers can use to quickly create sophisticated task tracking applications that will scale to enterprise levels \r\n* Based on open source software so as to be accessible to all developers and organizations, and to gain access to the open source community to leverage high caliber free development resources\r\n* Provide clear and complete documentation and test cases to make the framework understandable and extendable by experienced developers within enterprises (e.g. Fenwick & West) and the open source community\r\n\r\n# MyKanban World View …\r\n* Boards … are collections of tasks that need to be viewed and managed as a group (e.g. my personal tasks, or all tasks for a given team)\r\n* Board Sets … are templates for collections of boards that share the same structure.  The same project can be associated with more than one board in the same board set\r\n* Projects … are also collections of tasks that all support the same end deliverable (e.g. all tasks for a given client matter or IT project)\r\n* Tasks … are individual units of work assigned to one or more individuals\r\n* People … are associated with boards, projects, and tasks in a variety of ways: user, stakeholder, assignee, approver, etc.\r\n* Sprints … are time periods used for filtering views of tasks (e.g. 1/1/2015 through 1/15/2015)\r\nThe full MyKanban model contains many more structures, but these are the most apparent\r\n\r\n# The 3 Layers of MyKanban\r\n* The Database layer stores the MyKanban data as a set of SQL tables in either MySql or SQL Server\r\n* The API / Object Layer abstracts the data, making it much easier to build Kanban applications\r\n* The Appication Layer is where users interact with the MyKanban data\r\n\r\n# Sample UI # 1 - Object Browser\r\nCan be used as an administrative tool for creating and managing Kanban boards, but is also a great tool for developers to explore the MyKanban object layer.\r\n\r\n# Sample UI # 2 - Web Application\r\nProvides an example of a simple, web-based Kanban board UI.  This is a functional application that can be extended to meet particular needs\r\n\r\n# Sample UI #3 - Mobile\r\nProvides an example of a Cordova-based mobile UI based on the MyKanban API.  Can be extended as needed.  Again, designed primarily as a learning tool, and not expected to meet all needs\r\n\r\nNote: This project is ditributed under the GPL license.
